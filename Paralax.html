        <p>
            “I would hold you in my arms and say to your mother, this boy will be the best boy in the world.
            This boy will be someone better than anyone I've ever met. And you grew up wonderfully.
            It was wonderful to just watch you, every day was a privilege. Then it was time for you to be a made man and conquer the world, and you were.
            But at some point in your career, you changed. You stopped being you. You let people put your finger in your face and say you sucked.
            And when things got tough, you started looking for someone to blame, like a big shadow. Let me tell you something you already know.
            The world is not a bed of roses. It's a very cruel and sordid place, and no matter how tough you are, the world will beat you until you are on your knees and
            will keep you that way permanently if you let it. Neither you, nor I, nor anyone else hits harder than life. But the question is not how hard you hit.
            The question is how much you can take and keep going; how much you support and keep going. That's what wins are made of!
            Now, if you know how much you are worth, then go out there and claim. But you have to be willing to endure, and not point the finger saying that you are not
            where you should be because of him, hers, or nobody. Cowards do that, and you're not a coward. You're better than that! I will always love you, no matter what.
            Does not matter. You are my son, my blood. You are the best thing in my life. But until you start to believe in yourself, you won't have a life. ”
